FizzBuzz

This is a working copy of a basic FizzBuzz App which asks the user to enter a number and then will print out each number in
sequential order until the prompted value is reached. I do not have any validation for to ensure that a number is input but
I imagine that it wouldnt be that hard to implement. Anyways this is my first share on GitHub and I am new to programming 
so any critique is appreciated. 

Fizz prints for numbers divisible by 3 
buzz prints for numbers divisible by 5
FizzBuzz prints for numbers divisible by both 3 & 5
